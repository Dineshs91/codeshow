A scratchpad for code in browser

Powered entirely by [ace](http://ace.c9.io/), the amazing cloud editor. 

## why ?

The reason I wrote this is to show the difference between various programming languages. The code is darn simple.
Create 2 editors in ace and that's it.

You might ask, why not use a text editor ?
That's what I wouuld have gone for if I was giving the demo on my laptop. I was giving it on a company laptop and
to get the software you have to get permissions etc etc... So I figured, I could use ace and since every computer has
a built in browser, I don't have to install anything extra.

Circumvent the software policy :)
